Recently I created a Tableau Dashboard for monitoring and evaluating a bank's lending activities and performance, providing insights into key metrics, tracking changes over time, assessing portfolio health, and identifying trends to support data-driven decision-making.
This time, I worked on a dataset with over 38,000 rows and used SQL to verify the accuracy of the values.
